ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes
ðŸ”¹ ConfigMap

Used to store non-confidential configuration data (like environment variables, config files, URLs, app settings).

Example: database host, app mode (dev, prod).

ðŸ”¹ Secret

Used to store sensitive data (like passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates).

Data inside a Secret is base64 encoded (not fully encrypted, but safer than ConfigMap).

Real-world Example

Imagine youâ€™re deploying an application that connects to a database.

The database hostname is not sensitive â†’ goes into a ConfigMap.

The database password is sensitive â†’ goes into a Secret.
