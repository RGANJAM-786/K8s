🔹 What is StorageClass & Dynamic Volumes?

“In Kubernetes, a StorageClass is like a set of rules that tells Kubernetes how to create pv automatically whenever we create a pvc.
Normally, with static storage, we have to create PersistentVolumes (PVs) in advance.
But with dynamic volumes, Kubernetes will automatically create a PV whenever a developer makes a PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim).
This makes storage setup much faster and easier.”

🔹 How I used it in real projects

“In my project on AWS, we had many applications that needed storage.
Instead of creating EBS volumes manually for each app, we created a StorageClass (for example, gp2 for general-purpose SSD).
Then developers only created PVCs, and Kubernetes automatically created the matching EBS volume and attached it to their Pods.
This saved us a lot of time and reduced manual work.”

🔹 When is it more useful?

When you have many apps and you don’t want to create storage manually each time.

In cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) where storage can be created on demand.

When you want a standard way of giving storage to all teams.

When you need to scale easily without extra work for admins.

✅ Short & Simple Interview Answer:
“StorageClass in Kubernetes is used to automatically create storage (PVs) when a developer requests it with a PVC. 
I have used it on AWS to create EBS volumes dynamically. It’s more useful in real-world setups because it saves time, avoids manual work, and makes storage management scalable.”



🔹 Scenario-based Questions

PVC Pending Issue

👉 Your PVC is stuck in Pending state. How will you troubleshoot this if you’re using dynamic volumes?
(Checks: Is storageClassName correct? Does a matching StorageClass exist? Is the provisioner working? Do you have quota/permissions in cloud provider?)

Choosing StorageClass

👉 Your application needs very fast storage for a database. How would you make sure Kubernetes gives the right type of storage?
(Expected: Create or use a high-performance StorageClass, like AWS io1 or GCP ssd, and reference it in the PVC.)

Data Safety

👉 If a PVC using a StorageClass with reclaimPolicy: Delete is removed, what happens to the data? How would you change this if you want to keep the data?
(Expected: With Delete, the backend storage is deleted. Change reclaimPolicy to Retain if you want to preserve data.)

Multi-team Environment

👉 You have multiple teams creating PVCs, but you want one team to use fast SSD storage and another team to use cheaper HDD storage. How would you manage this?
(Expected: Create multiple StorageClasses, e.g., fast-ssd and standard-hdd, and instruct teams to reference the right one in their PVCs.)

Migrating Apps

👉 You are moving your workloads from on-prem to AWS. On-prem you used NFS with static PVs. In AWS, you want to simplify storage. What would you use?
(Expected: Use dynamic provisioning with a StorageClass that creates EBS volumes automatically instead of pre-creating PVs.)

PVC Deleted by Mistake

👉 A developer deleted their PVC, but they want their data back. The StorageClass had reclaimPolicy: Retain. What steps would you take to recover the data?
(Expected: Data is still safe, PV is in Released state. Remove old claimRef, create a new PVC with the same specs, and rebind it.)

Scaling Applications

👉 You deploy 50 replicas of a stateful application that each need their own storage. How would StorageClass and dynamic volumes help here?
(Expected: Kubernetes automatically provisions separate PVs for each PVC requested by the StatefulSet, instead of admins creating 50 PVs manually.)

Storage in CI/CD

👉 In your CI/CD pipeline, you need temporary storage for builds. How would you set this up in Kubernetes?
(Expected: Use a StorageClass with fast ephemeral storage, or configure a dynamic volume with Delete reclaim policy so that storage is cleaned up when PVC is removed.)
