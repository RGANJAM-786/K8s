🔹 What is Helm?

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, similar to apt (Ubuntu) or yum (RHEL).

It lets you package, version, share, and deploy Kubernetes manifests easily.

A Helm Chart = a collection of YAML templates (like Deployment, Service, Ingress, ConfigMap) that together define an application.

👉 Instead of writing multiple YAMLs manually, Helm makes it reusable, parameterized, and easy to deploy in different environments.

🔹 How Helm helped in my project (Real-Time Use)

In one of my projects:

We had a microservices-based application with 10+ services. Each service had its own Deployment, Service, ConfigMaps, Ingress, etc.

Maintaining these YAMLs manually was painful.

For every environment (dev, qa, prod), we had different configurations (replica count, image tag, resource limits).

We packaged each service into a Helm Chart.

Example: values-dev.yaml, values-qa.yaml, values-prod.yaml contained environment-specific configs.

Same chart, different values → easy deployments.

During CI/CD:

Jenkins pipeline used Helm commands (helm upgrade --install) to deploy new versions.

Rollbacks were simple → helm rollback.

👉 Outcome:

Saved time in managing YAML files.

Easier upgrades and rollbacks.

Consistent deployments across environments.

🔹 Common Helm Commands I Used

Install a chart:

helm install myapp ./myapp-chart -n dev


Installs app using the chart in the current directory.

Upgrade / Deploy new version:

helm upgrade myapp ./myapp-chart -f values-dev.yaml -n dev


Updates the running release (rolling update style).

Rollback to previous release:

helm rollback myapp 1 -n dev


Goes back to revision 1 of the release.

List Helm releases:

helm list -n dev


Uninstall a release:

helm uninstall myapp -n dev


Template rendering (dry-run to see YAML before applying):

helm template myapp ./myapp-chart -f values.yaml

🔹 Why Helm is Useful

Reusability: One chart can deploy apps in multiple environments (dev, qa, prod) with different values.yaml.

Simplifies Deployment: Instead of writing 10 YAML files, one Helm command deploys everything.

Version Control: Helm keeps a history of releases → easy rollback.

Integration with CI/CD: Automates deployments using pipelines.

Community Charts: Huge library of prebuilt charts for databases, monitoring tools, etc. (MySQL, Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana, etc.).

✅ Interview-Friendly Short Answer:
"Yes, I’ve worked with Helm in my projects. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that uses charts to simplify deployments. 
I used it to package microservices into reusable charts, with environment-specific values for dev/qa/prod.
The most common commands I used were helm install, helm upgrade, helm rollback, and helm list. It was very useful for consistent deployments, easy rollbacks, and automation in CI/CD pipelines.”

🔹 How You Use It in Real-Time

Install app in dev namespace:

helm install javawebapp ./javawebapp -f values-dev.yaml -n dev


Upgrade app with a new image tag:

helm upgrade javawebapp ./javawebapp -f values-dev.yaml --set image.tag=1.3 -n dev


Rollback if new version fails:

helm rollback javawebapp 1 -n dev


Check history:

helm history javawebapp -n dev


✅ Interview Style Answer Example:
"Yes, I have created and worked with Helm charts. For example, I packaged our Java web app into a Helm chart. The chart had templates for Deployment, Service, and ConfigMaps. We used values.yaml to manage environment-specific settings like replicas, image tags, and resource requests. In CI/CD, we used helm upgrade for deploying new versions and helm rollback for reverting if something failed. This approach saved time, avoided manual YAML edits, and made rollouts safer and consistent.”


🔹 Scenario-Based Helm Interview Questions
1. Scenario:

Your team needs to deploy the same application in dev, staging, and production, but each environment requires different replica counts, resource limits, and image tags.
👉 Question: How will you manage these differences using Helm?

✅ Answer:
I would use values.yaml files for each environment (like values-dev.yaml, values-staging.yaml, values-prod.yaml).
When deploying, I pass the correct file:

helm install myapp ./chart -f values-prod.yaml -n prod


This way, the templates remain the same, but each environment gets its own configuration.

2. Scenario:

A new version of your app was deployed using Helm, but users reported that some features broke.
👉 Question: How would you quickly roll back to the previous stable version?

✅ Answer:
I would check the release history with:

helm history myapp -n prod


Then roll back to the last working version:

helm rollback myapp 2 -n prod


This ensures the app goes back to a stable state without manual YAML changes.

3. Scenario:

Your CI/CD pipeline needs to automatically update the Docker image version when a new build is pushed.
👉 Question: How will you achieve this with Helm?

✅ Answer:
We can use the --set flag during helm upgrade:

helm upgrade myapp ./chart --set image.tag=1.4 -n dev


This overrides the image.tag from values.yaml. In CI/CD, the build system can inject the new version dynamically.

4. Scenario:

You want to ensure every Helm deployment has a unique name so that multiple environments can run in the same cluster.
👉 Question: How will you handle this?

✅ Answer:
Helm allows setting the release name during install:

helm install javawebapp-dev ./chart -n dev
helm install javawebapp-prod ./chart -n prod


The templates use {{ .Release.Name }}, so the resources get unique names automatically.

5. Scenario:

Sometimes, you need to debug a Helm chart because the generated YAML doesn’t work as expected.
👉 Question: What command will you use to see the final YAML before applying?

✅ Answer:
I would run:

helm template myapp ./chart -f values.yaml


This shows the final Kubernetes manifests after Helm renders templates. I can review and debug before deploying.

6. Scenario:

Your application requires ConfigMaps and Secrets, and these values differ per environment.
👉 Question: How will you manage them in Helm?

✅ Answer:
I would create ConfigMap and Secret templates inside templates/ folder and pass values from values.yaml.
For example, configmap.yaml would use:

data:
  DB_HOST: {{ .Values.db.host }}
  DB_PORT: {{ .Values.db.port }}


Then in values-prod.yaml, I provide the actual DB details.

7. Scenario:

Your company wants to make sure that developers can easily deploy apps without writing Helm charts from scratch.
👉 Question: How would you make this easier?

✅ Answer:
I would create a Helm chart repository (using Nexus/Artifactory or GitHub Pages) where we publish reusable charts. Developers just run:

helm repo add mycompany http://repo.company.com/charts
helm install myapp mycompany/javawebapp


This saves time and ensures consistency across projects.


🚀 Step-by-Step Helm in CI/CD Pipelines
1. Developer commits new code

A developer pushes new code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.

This triggers a CI/CD pipeline (like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions).

2. Build & push Docker image

The first pipeline stage builds a new Docker image for the app.
Example (Jenkinsfile or CI/CD YAML):

docker build -t myrepo/javawebapp:1.5 .
docker push myrepo/javawebapp:1.5


The image is stored in a registry (DockerHub, ECR, GCR, etc.).

3. Update Helm values

The pipeline updates the Helm chart with the new image tag.
Example using Helm --set:

helm upgrade javawebapp ./helm-chart \
  --set image.repository=myrepo/javawebapp \
  --set image.tag=1.5 \
  -n dev


This avoids manually editing values.yaml.

4. Deploy to Kubernetes

Helm upgrades (or installs) the application in Kubernetes.
Commands:

helm upgrade --install javawebapp ./helm-chart -n dev


If the release doesn’t exist, --install creates it; if it exists, Helm upgrades it.

5. Verification stage

Pipeline checks rollout status:

kubectl rollout status deployment/javawebapp -n dev


Optionally, run health checks or API tests.

6. Promotion to staging & production

Once tested in dev, pipeline promotes the same chart to staging or production with different values:

helm upgrade --install javawebapp ./helm-chart -f values-staging.yaml -n staging


Each environment has its own values.yaml (replicas, resource limits, DB config, etc.).

7. Rollback (if needed)

If deployment fails, rollback is easy:

helm rollback javawebapp 3 -n dev


This brings back the last working version without downtime.

✅ Why Helm is useful in CI/CD?

Reusability → Same chart works in dev, staging, prod.

Automation → No manual YAML edits, pipeline updates image tags dynamically.

Version Control → Helm tracks release history (easy rollback).

Consistency → Every environment runs the same base chart, only values differ.


🔹 Part 1: Common Helm Interview Questions & Answers
Q1: How do you handle Helm values per environment?

👉 Answer:
In real projects, each environment (dev, staging, prod) has its own configuration.

I create separate values-dev.yaml, values-staging.yaml, and values-prod.yaml.

These files include environment-specific details like:

Replica count

Resource requests/limits

ConfigMaps & Secrets

Domain URLs

Example:

helm upgrade --install javawebapp ./helm-chart -f values-prod.yaml -n prod


✅ This way, the same chart works across multiple environments without changing the core YAMLs.

Q2: How do you pass image tags dynamically from CI/CD?

👉 Answer:
I don’t hardcode the image tag in values.yaml. Instead, my pipeline injects the new tag dynamically.

Example:

helm upgrade --install javawebapp ./helm-chart \
  --set image.repository=myrepo/javawebapp \
  --set image.tag=${BUILD_NUMBER} \
  -n dev


✅ This ensures every new build automatically updates the deployment with the latest image.

Q3: How do you ensure rollback if a new version fails?

👉 Answer:
Helm maintains release history. If a deployment fails:

helm rollback javawebapp 3 -n dev


(where 3 is the release revision).

✅ This reverts back to the last working version without downtime (if RollingUpdate strategy is used).

🔹 Part 2: Real-World Failure Scenario
Scenario:

You deployed a new version (1.5) using Helm. After deployment, the app pods are in CrashLoopBackOff.

Steps to Troubleshoot:

Check rollout status

kubectl rollout status deployment/javawebapp -n dev


If rollout stuck → something wrong with new Pods.

Check Helm history

helm history javawebapp -n dev


See last successful revision.

Check Pod logs

kubectl logs <pod-name> -n dev


Example: maybe DB password is missing from Secret.

Describe pod

kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n dev


Look for ImagePullBackOff (wrong image) or ConfigMap not found.

Rollback to last good version

helm rollback javawebapp 3 -n dev


✅ This restores the app immediately.

Fix the root cause

If bad image tag → rebuild & push correct image.

If wrong config in Helm values → update values-dev.yaml.

If missing Secret/ConfigMap → create it, then redeploy.

🔹 Summary (How you’d answer in an interview)

“In my project, we use Helm for Kubernetes deployments. Each environment has its own values.yaml for customization.
When a new build is triggered, the pipeline updates the image tag dynamically in Helm, and deploys the release. If something goes wrong, I check rollout status, logs, and Helm history. Since Helm keeps track of release history, I can rollback instantly with helm rollback.
A real example was when a bad image tag was pushed; the pods went into CrashLoopBackOff. I quickly identified it, rolled back to the previous version, and then rebuilt the image with the correct tag. This reduced downtime and kept the app stable.”
