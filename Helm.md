🔹 What is Helm?

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, similar to apt (Ubuntu) or yum (RHEL).

It lets you package, version, share, and deploy Kubernetes manifests easily.

A Helm Chart = a collection of YAML templates (like Deployment, Service, Ingress, ConfigMap) that together define an application.

👉 Instead of writing multiple YAMLs manually, Helm makes it reusable, parameterized, and easy to deploy in different environments.

🔹 How Helm helped in my project (Real-Time Use)

In one of my projects:

We had a microservices-based application with 10+ services. Each service had its own Deployment, Service, ConfigMaps, Ingress, etc.

Maintaining these YAMLs manually was painful.

For every environment (dev, qa, prod), we had different configurations (replica count, image tag, resource limits).

We packaged each service into a Helm Chart.

Example: values-dev.yaml, values-qa.yaml, values-prod.yaml contained environment-specific configs.

Same chart, different values → easy deployments.

During CI/CD:

Jenkins pipeline used Helm commands (helm upgrade --install) to deploy new versions.

Rollbacks were simple → helm rollback.

👉 Outcome:

Saved time in managing YAML files.

Easier upgrades and rollbacks.

Consistent deployments across environments.

🔹 Common Helm Commands I Used

Install a chart:

helm install myapp ./myapp-chart -n dev


Installs app using the chart in the current directory.

Upgrade / Deploy new version:

helm upgrade myapp ./myapp-chart -f values-dev.yaml -n dev


Updates the running release (rolling update style).

Rollback to previous release:

helm rollback myapp 1 -n dev


Goes back to revision 1 of the release.

List Helm releases:

helm list -n dev


Uninstall a release:

helm uninstall myapp -n dev


Template rendering (dry-run to see YAML before applying):

helm template myapp ./myapp-chart -f values.yaml

🔹 Why Helm is Useful

Reusability: One chart can deploy apps in multiple environments (dev, qa, prod) with different values.yaml.

Simplifies Deployment: Instead of writing 10 YAML files, one Helm command deploys everything.

Version Control: Helm keeps a history of releases → easy rollback.

Integration with CI/CD: Automates deployments using pipelines.

Community Charts: Huge library of prebuilt charts for databases, monitoring tools, etc. (MySQL, Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana, etc.).

✅ Interview-Friendly Short Answer:
"Yes, I’ve worked with Helm in my projects. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that uses charts to simplify deployments. 
I used it to package microservices into reusable charts, with environment-specific values for dev/qa/prod.
The most common commands I used were helm install, helm upgrade, helm rollback, and helm list. It was very useful for consistent deployments, easy rollbacks, and automation in CI/CD pipelines.”


📦 Example Helm Chart for a Java Web App

When you run helm create javawebapp, it creates this folder structure:

javawebapp/
├── Chart.yaml              # Info about the chart (name, version, description)
├── values.yaml             # Default configuration (can be overridden per env)
├── templates/              # All Kubernetes manifests in template form
│   ├── deployment.yaml     # Deployment template
│   ├── service.yaml        # Service template
│   ├── ingress.yaml        # Ingress template (optional)
│   ├── configmap.yaml      # ConfigMap template (optional)
│   └── _helpers.tpl        # Helper templates for naming conventions
