🔹 Reclaim Policy (Retain Policy) in Kubernetes

When a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is deleted, Kubernetes needs to decide what to do with the PersistentVolume (PV) that was bound to it.
This is controlled by the reclaim policy of the PV.

🔹 Types of Reclaim Policies (Status)

🔹Retain

PV is not deleted when the PVC is deleted.

The data is preserved.

The PV goes into a Released state but is not yet available for new PVCs until an admin manually cleans up and makes it Available.

Use case: When data is important (e.g., database data) and should not be lost automatically.

🔹Delete

Both the PV and the underlying storage (like AWS EBS, GCP PD, Azure Disk) are deleted automatically when the PVC is deleted.

Use case: For temporary workloads where you don’t care about keeping data.

🔹Recycle (⚠️ deprecated)

PV’s data is scrubbed (files deleted with rm -rf /thevolume/*) and then the PV becomes Available again.

This was insecure and is deprecated.

🔹 PV Lifecycle Statuses

A PersistentVolume can be in one of these statuses:

Available → PV is free and not bound to any PVC.

Bound → PV is bound to a PVC and in use.

Released → PVC was deleted, but PV still exists (data may still be there). Happens when reclaim policy is Retain.

Failed → PV has failed due to some error.

🔹 When do these come into picture?

If PVC is deleted and reclaim policy = Retain → PV moves to Released (admin action needed).

If PVC is deleted and reclaim policy = Delete → PV and actual storage are deleted immediately.

If reclaim policy = Recycle (old) → PV is scrubbed and goes back to Available.

✅ Interview-style Answer:
“In Kubernetes, reclaim policy defines what happens to a PersistentVolume after its claim (PVC) is deleted. There are three types: Retain (data preserved, PV goes to Released state), Delete (PV and storage are deleted), and Recycle (deprecated). A PV can be in four states — Available, Bound, Released, and Failed — depending on whether it’s free, in use, released after PVC deletion, or failed due to errors.”



🔹 Scenario 1: Database with Retain Policy

Situation:
You are running a MySQL database on Kubernetes. Its PVC is backed by a PV with Retain reclaim policy. One of your teammates accidentally deletes the PVC.

Question:
What happens to the data and the PV in this case?

Answer:

The PVC is deleted.

The PV goes into Released state (because the data is still there).

The actual storage (disk) and data are not deleted.

But the PV cannot be reused by another PVC until an admin manually cleans and reclaims it.

This ensures important data (like DB records) is not lost accidentally.

🔹 Scenario 2: Application Logs with Delete Policy

Situation:
A logging application uses a PVC backed by a PV with Delete policy. After testing, you delete the PVC.

Question:
What happens?

Answer:

The PVC is deleted.

Kubernetes also deletes the PV and the underlying storage resource (EBS, GCP disk, etc.).

This is fine for logs or temporary workloads where data persistence isn’t critical.

🔹 Scenario 3: PV Status Transition

Situation:
You have a PV with Retain policy bound to a PVC. The PVC is deleted.

Question:
What will be the status of the PV, and can another PVC use it immediately?

Answer:

The PV status changes from Bound → Released.

It cannot be bound to another PVC automatically because old data is still present.

An admin must manually clean up the storage and mark it as Available again.

✅ Interview Tip:
When you explain, add why Retain is important → “In production, for critical apps like databases, Retain policy ensures that data is not lost even if someone deletes the PVC by mistake.”
