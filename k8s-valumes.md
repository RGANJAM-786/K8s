"hostPath volumes directly use the node’s filesystem, which makes them non-portable, insecure, and tied to specific nodes. If the Pod moves to another node, the data won’t be there. That’s why in production we prefer PersistentVolumes with network-backed storage (like EBS, NFS, Ceph, etc.)."

 Let’s take a real-time Jenkins example because Jenkins is a common DevOps tool and interviewers love it.

🔹 Scenario 1: Using hostPath Volume

You deploy Jenkins in Kubernetes and store its job data under /var/jenkins_home.

volumes:
- name: jenkins-data
  hostPath:
    path: /data/jenkins


Node A has /data/jenkins folder.

Jenkins Pod runs on Node A, jobs are created, data is stored there.

Next day, Node A crashes. Scheduler reschedules Jenkins Pod on Node B.

👉 Problem: On Node B, /data/jenkins is empty (or doesn’t even exist).
➡️ Jenkins lost all jobs and build history.

🔹 Scenario 2: Using PersistentVolume (EBS/NFS/CSI)

Instead of hostPath, you use a PersistentVolume (PV) backed by EBS/NFS/Cloud disk.

volumes:
- name: jenkins-data
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: jenkins-pvc


Jenkins Pod starts on Node A, stores data on the PersistentVolume.

If Node A crashes, Pod gets rescheduled on Node B.

The PersistentVolume (EBS/NFS) is re-attached to Node B, and Jenkins continues with all job history intact.

👉 Benefit: Data is portable, durable, and safe.

🎯 Interview One-liner (Jenkins Example)

“If I store Jenkins data using hostPath, the data stays only on one node. If that node crashes, I lose all Jenkins jobs. But if I use a PersistentVolume, the data is attached to any node where the Pod runs. That’s why hostPath is unsafe in production and we go for PV/PVC.”


🔹 Expanded Explanation


🔹NFS (Network File System)

NFS is like a shared folder on a server that multiple machines can access at the same time.

In Kubernetes, instead of each Pod having its own isolated storage, we can use NFS to provide shared and persistent storage to Pods.

Example: Two replicas of a web app Pod can read/write the same files because both are connected to the same NFS backend.


🔹PV (PersistentVolume)

Kubernetes does not directly “know” about NFS, EBS, or other storage systems.

To integrate storage into Kubernetes, we create a PersistentVolume (PV).

Think of PV as a wrapper inside Kubernetes that represents external storage.

The PV object describes details like:

What type of storage (NFS, EBS, Azure Disk, etc.)

How much space (e.g., 5Gi)

Access modes (ReadWriteOnce, ReadWriteMany, etc.)


🔹PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)

Applications (Pods) don’t directly talk to the PV.

Instead, the developer writes a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).

PVC is like saying: “I need 2GB of storage, with ReadWriteMany access.”

Kubernetes then matches the PVC to a suitable PV.

This separation allows developers to request storage without worrying about backend details.


🔹Binding PV & PVC

Once Kubernetes finds a matching PV, it binds it to the PVC.

Now the PVC acts as a bridge between the Pod and the actual storage.

Pods always use PVC names to mount storage.


🔹 Pod Uses the PVC

Finally, inside the Pod spec, we reference the PVC.

Kubernetes mounts the underlying storage (via PV) into the container.

This ensures data persists even if the Pod is deleted/restarted.


🔹 One-Line Interview Style Statements

“NFS is the backend storage system, PV is the Kubernetes object that represents that storage, PVC is how users request storage, and Pods mount PVCs to actually use the storage.”

“This abstraction makes storage portable – developers don’t need to know if the storage is NFS, EBS, or Azure Disk. They just request via PVC.”

“It also helps in multi-team environments: admins manage PVs, developers just use PVCs.”



Great 👍 Let’s prepare some ready-made interview answers for you.

❓ Q: What is the difference between PV and PVC in Kubernetes?

✅ Answer (Simple & Clear):
“PV (PersistentVolume) is the actual storage resource in Kubernetes that represents external storage like NFS, AWS EBS, or Azure Disk. PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) is a request made by a user or application for storage. In short, PV is the supply, PVC is the demand. Once a PVC matches a PV, the Pod can use the PVC to mount storage.”

❓ Q: Why do we need PVC when we already have PV?

✅ Answer:
“We use PVC because developers shouldn’t worry about the details of the storage system. PVs are usually created and managed by cluster admins, while PVCs allow developers to just request storage based on size and access needs. This separation of responsibility makes Kubernetes storage portable and easier to manage.”

❓ Q: Can you explain with an example how PV, PVC, and Pod work together?

✅ Answer:
“Let’s say I have an NFS server with 10GB of space. I create a PV in Kubernetes that represents that NFS share. Now, my application needs 2GB of storage, so I create a PVC asking for 2GB. Kubernetes matches the PVC with the PV and binds them. Finally, in my Pod spec, I mount the PVC. This way, my Pod gets persistent storage, and even if the Pod is deleted or rescheduled, the data is still safe in the NFS backend.”

❓ Q: How would you explain this with a real-world analogy?

✅ Answer:
“Think of PV as a parking lot (storage space) managed by the admin. PVC is like a request ticket where a driver says: ‘I need one parking spot.’ Once the ticket matches with a free spot, the driver (Pod) can park there. The driver doesn’t care about the details of the lot, only that they got a spot to use.”
