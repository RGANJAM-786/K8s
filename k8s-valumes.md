➡️hostPath volumes

"hostPath volumes directly use the node’s filesystem, and tied to specific nodes. If the Pod moves to another node, the data won’t be there. That’s why we prefer PersistentVolumes & PersistentVolumeclaims with network-backed storage (like EBS, NFS, Ceph, etc.)."

 Let’s take a real-time Jenkins example because Jenkins is a common DevOps tool and interviewers love it.

🔹 Scenario 1: Using hostPath Volume

You deploy Jenkins in Kubernetes and store its job data under /var/jenkins_home.

volumes:
- name: jenkins-data
  hostPath:
    path: /data/jenkins


Node A has /data/jenkins folder.

Jenkins Pod runs on Node A, jobs are created, data is stored there.

Next day, Node A crashes. Scheduler reschedules Jenkins Pod on Node B.

👉 Problem: On Node B, /data/jenkins is empty (or doesn’t even exist).
➡️ Jenkins lost all jobs and build history.

🔹 Scenario 2: Using PersistentVolume (EBS/NFS/CSI)

Instead of hostPath, you use a PersistentVolume (PV) backed by EBS/NFS/Cloud disk.

volumes:
- name: jenkins-data
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: jenkins-pvc


Jenkins Pod starts on Node A, stores data on the PersistentVolume.

If Node A crashes, Pod gets rescheduled on Node B.

The PersistentVolume (EBS/NFS) is re-attached to Node B, and Jenkins continues with all job history intact.

👉 Benefit: Data is portable, durable, and safe.

🎯 Interview One-liner (Jenkins Example)

“If I store Jenkins data using hostPath, the data stays only on one node. If that node crashes, I lose all Jenkins jobs. But if I use a PersistentVolume, the data is attached to any node where the Pod runs. That’s why hostPath is unsafe in production and we go for PV/PVC.”


🔹 Expanded Explanation


🔹NFS (Network File System)

NFS is like a shared folder on a server that multiple machines can access at the same time.

In Kubernetes, instead of each Pod having its own isolated storage, we can use NFS to provide shared and persistent storage to Pods.

Example: Two replicas of a web app Pod can read/write the same files because both are connected to the same NFS backend.


🔹PV (PersistentVolume)

Kubernetes does not directly “know” about NFS, EBS, or other storage systems.

To integrate storage into Kubernetes, we create a PersistentVolume (PV).

Think of PV as a wrapper inside Kubernetes that represents external storage.

The PV object describes details like:

What type of storage (NFS, EBS, Azure Disk, etc.)

How much space (e.g., 5Gi)

Access modes (ReadWriteOnce, ReadWriteMany, etc.)


🔹PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)

Applications (Pods) don’t directly talk to the PV.

Instead, the developer writes a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).

PVC is like saying: “I need 2GB of storage, with ReadWriteMany access.”

Kubernetes then matches the PVC to a suitable PV.

This separation allows developers to request storage without worrying about backend details.


🔹Binding PV & PVC

Once Kubernetes finds a matching PV, it binds it to the PVC.

Now the PVC acts as a bridge between the Pod and the actual storage.

Pods always use PVC names to mount storage.


🔹 Pod Uses the PVC

Finally, inside the Pod spec, we reference the PVC.

Kubernetes mounts the underlying storage (via PV) into the container.

This ensures data persists even if the Pod is deleted/restarted.


🔹 One-Line Interview Style Statements

“NFS is the backend storage system, PV is the Kubernetes object that represents that storage, PVC is how users request storage, and Pods mount PVCs to actually use the storage.”

“This abstraction makes storage portable – developers don’t need to know if the storage is NFS, EBS, or Azure Disk. They just request via PVC.”

“It also helps in multi-team environments: admins manage PVs, developers just use PVCs.”



Great 👍 Let’s prepare some ready-made interview answers for you.

❓ Q: What is the difference between PV and PVC in Kubernetes?


✅“PV (PersistentVolume) is the actual storage resource in Kubernetes that represents external storage like NFS, AWS EBS, or Azure Disk.

✅PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) is a request made by a user or application for storage. In short, PV is the supply, PVC is the demand. Once a PVC matches a PV, the Pod can use the PVC to mount storage.”

❓ Q: Can you explain with an example how PV, PVC, and Pod work together?

✅ Answer:
“Let’s say I have an NFS server with 10GB of space. I create a PV in Kubernetes that represents that NFS share. Now, my application needs 2GB of storage, so I create a PVC asking for 2GB. Kubernetes matches the PVC with the PV and binds them. Finally, in my Pod spec, I mount the PVC. This way, my Pod gets persistent storage, and even if the Pod is deleted or rescheduled, the data is still safe in the NFS backend.”

PVC finds a PV based on storage class, access modes, size, and optional labels.

🔎 What happens if no matching PV is found for a PVC?

PVC stays in "Pending" state

When you create a PVC, Kubernetes tries to find a PV that matches it.

If it doesn’t find one, the PVC is created but remains in Pending status.

👉 “When a PVC is created, Kubernetes tries to match it with an existing PV based on size, access mode, and storage class. If no matching PV is available, the PVC will stay in Pending. If a StorageClass is defined, Kubernetes can dynamically provision a new PV automatically; otherwise, an admin must create a PV manually.”


❓ Why do we need PVC when we already have PV?

Think of it like this:

PV (PersistentVolume) = A storage resource created by the Kubernetes admin.
Example: A 100GB disk from AWS EBS or a shared folder from NFS.

PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) = A request for storage made by the developer/application.
Example: “I need 5GB of storage to save my app data.”

👉 Without PVC:

Developers would need to know all the details of the storage (NFS path, AWS disk ID, etc.) when every time they create a Pod.

This is difficult and unsafe, because developers may not have access to cloud/storage infra.

👉 With PVC:

The cluster admin sets up PVs (storage supply).

Developers simply create PVCs (storage requests) without worrying about where the actual disk is.

Kubernetes automatically matches PVC with PV (like connecting demand to supply).


❓ Q: How would you explain this with a real-world analogy?

✅ Answer:
“Think of PV as a parking lot (storage space) managed by the admin. PVC is like a request ticket where a driver says: ‘I need one parking spot.’ Once the ticket matches with a free spot, the driver (Pod) can park there. The driver doesn’t care about the details of the lot, only that they got a spot to use.”


👉 “hostPath volumes are like saving your files on the local hard drive of one computer. If your application moves to another computer, those files won’t follow it, so the data is lost. It’s also less secure because it directly touches the computer’s system files. That’s why in real production setups, we use shared storage systems (like cloud disks or NFS) that are available to all computers in the cluster, so the data always stays safe and accessible.”



👍lets assume you provide same access mode & storage for two pvc & now how the pv will bound with any one , can you explain?
ChatGPT said:

Scenario:

You have two PVCs.

Both request the same size, same access mode, and same storage class.

You have one PV that matches these conditions.

How Kubernetes decides:

Kubernetes follows a first-come, first-serve approach.

The first PVC that matches the PV’s requirements will bind to it.

Once a PV is bound to a PVC, it cannot be claimed by another PVC (it’s exclusive binding).

The second PVC will remain in Pending state until either:

Another matching PV is created (manually or dynamically via StorageClass), or

The first PVC is deleted and the PV is released (depending on the reclaim policy).

✅ Simple Statement for Interview:
"If two PVCs request the same kind of storage, Kubernetes binds the PV to whichever PVC is processed first. A PV can only be bound to one PVC at a time, so the second PVC will stay pending until another suitable PV is available."



🔹 Volume Scenario-Based Questions
1. emptyDir Volume

Scenario:
Your Pod uses an emptyDir volume for caching data. After a node restart, you notice the data is gone.

Question: Why did this happen?

Expected Answer: emptyDir volumes live only as long as the Pod runs on that node. If the Pod is deleted, restarted, or rescheduled to another node, the data inside emptyDir is lost. It’s for temporary storage, not persistence.

2. hostPath Volume

Scenario:
You use a hostPath volume to store logs in /var/log/app on the node. Later, your Pod moves to another node, and the logs are missing.

Question: Why did this happen?

Expected Answer: hostPath directly uses the node’s filesystem. Data stays on that node only. When the Pod moves to another node, the data won’t be there, which is why it’s not portable.

3. PersistentVolume + PersistentVolumeClaim

Scenario:
You created a PVC requesting 10Gi storage, but the Pod is stuck in Pending state because it cannot bind to any PV.

Question: How do you debug and fix this?

Expected Answer: Check if a PV with at least 10Gi and the same accessMode exists. If not, either create a matching PV or reduce the PVC request.

4. Multiple PVCs

Scenario:
Two PVCs are requesting 5Gi ReadWriteOnce access mode storage. You have only one PV of 5Gi available.

Question: Which PVC will bind, and what happens to the other?

Expected Answer: Only the first PVC will bind to the PV. The second PVC will stay in Pending until another matching PV is created.

5. Access Modes

Scenario:
Your team deployed an application that needs multiple Pods to write to the same storage. They created a PVC with ReadWriteOnce access mode. Some Pods fail to start.

Question: Why is this happening?

Expected Answer: ReadWriteOnce allows mounting storage on only one node. For multi-pod write access across nodes, we should use ReadWriteMany with a backend like NFS or Ceph.

6. Dynamic Provisioning

Scenario:
You create a PVC, but it doesn’t bind because no PV exists. Suddenly, a PV appears and binds automatically.

Question: What feature allowed this to happen?

Expected Answer: Dynamic provisioning via StorageClass. The PVC triggered the provisioner to create a PV on-demand from the underlying storage provider (like AWS EBS, GCP PD, etc.).

7. Node Failure

Scenario:
Your Pod is using an AWS EBS-backed PVC. The node where the Pod was running fails. The Pod is rescheduled to another node, but it can’t start.

Question: Why might this happen?

Expected Answer: AWS EBS volumes can only be attached to one node at a time in the same availability zone. Kubernetes needs to detach from the failed node before re-attaching to the new one.

8. Permission Issues

Scenario:
You mounted a PV into your Pod, but the application fails with a “permission denied” error when trying to write data.

Question: What could be wrong, and how do you fix it?

Expected Answer: The file system permissions on the volume may not match the container’s user. Fix by adjusting securityContext in Pod spec (e.g., runAsUser, fsGroup) or pre-setting permissions on the volume.

✅ Pro tip for interviews: Always explain why the issue happens + how to debug it (kubectl describe pvc/pv/pod) + how to fix it. That shows real-world troubleshooting skills.
