ReplicationController is one of the important features in Kubernetes that manages the lifecycle of Pods. Its main responsibility is to make sure that the desired number of Pod replicas are always running.

It helps you easily create multiple Pods and ensures that this number is always maintained.

If a Pod crashes or is deleted, the ReplicationController automatically replaces it with a new one.

ReplicationControllers work closely with labels to identify and manage Pods.

Even if you set the replica count to 1, it guarantees that at least one Pod of your application is always available.

“A ReplicationController in Kubernetes ensures that the desired number of Pods are always running. For example, if I set replicas to 3, it will create 3 Pods and if one fails, it immediately replaces it. It uses labels to identify which Pods to manage. Even with just 1 replica, it makes sure at least one Pod is always running, which ensures high availability. Today, ReplicaSets and Deployments are more commonly used, but the concept started with ReplicationController.”

✅ReplicationController: 
ReplicationController was the first way in Kubernetes to ensure Pods are always running, but it only supported equality-based selectors. ReplicaSet replaced it by adding set-based selectors. In practice, we don’t usually use either RC or RS directly — instead, we use Deployments, which manage ReplicaSets internally and provide powerful features like rolling updates, rollbacks, and easy scaling. So, in production, Deployments are the standard.”


✅ ReplicaSet:
“A ReplicaSet in Kubernetes makes sure the desired number of Pods are always running, similar to ReplicationController. The key difference is that ReplicaSet supports set-based label selectors, which makes it more flexible. For example, I can tell it to manage Pods with labels app in (frontend, backend). In modern Kubernetes, we usually don’t create ReplicaSets directly — instead, Deployments manage ReplicaSets for us and add features like rolling updates and rollbacks.”


✅ Deployment in Kubernetes:
A Deployment is the standard way to run and manage applications in Kubernetes. It manages ReplicaSets, which in turn manage Pods. The advantage of a Deployment is that it supports rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling. For example, if I want to update my app to a new version, the Deployment gradually replaces old Pods with new ones to avoid downtime. If something fails, it can rollback automatically. That’s why Deployments are widely used in production instead of using ReplicaSets directly.”


 ✅DaemonSet
DaemonSet in Kubernetes ensures that one copy of a Pod runs on every node in the cluster. It’s used for system-level services like log collectors, monitoring agents, or networking components that need to run everywhere. For example, if I deploy a DaemonSet with a monitoring agent, it will automatically start one agent Pod on every node, and if a new node joins the cluster, the DaemonSet creates a Pod there too. This is different from Deployments, which focus on running a desired number of replicas across nodes, not necessarily one per node.”
