ReplicationController is one of the important features in Kubernetes that manages the lifecycle of Pods. Its main responsibility is to make sure that the desired number of Pod replicas are always running.

It helps you easily create multiple Pods and ensures that this number is always maintained.

If a Pod crashes or is deleted, the ReplicationController automatically replaces it with a new one.

ReplicationControllers work closely with labels to identify and manage Pods.

Even if you set the replica count to 1, it guarantees that at least one Pod of your application is always available.

“A ReplicationController in Kubernetes ensures that the desired number of Pods are always running. For example, if I set replicas to 3, it will create 3 Pods and if one fails, it immediately replaces it. It uses labels to identify which Pods to manage. Even with just 1 replica, it makes sure at least one Pod is always running, which ensures high availability. Today, ReplicaSets and Deployments are more commonly used, but the concept started with ReplicationController.”
